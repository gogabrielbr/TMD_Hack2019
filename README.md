Comparative International News Feed Data Visualization - 
Mapping international news by analyzing feeds from international news agencies (exp: AP, Bloomberg, Reuters), national news services (exp: Russia Today, Xinhua) and cross-analyzing their respective twitter feed. The goal is to create a tool for quickly visualizing different perspectives on international news. 

Twitter feeds from local news sources are to be compared with the RSS feeds of national news services (official and “extra”-official ones) in order to get a more detailed and granular view of its coverage os specific themes. This data can then be compared with news agencies feed.


Official national news services, often a direct branch of local governments, are the main source of international news
